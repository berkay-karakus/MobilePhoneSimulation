# MobilePhoneSimulation
I implemented a simple mobile phone behaviors by using composition.
Firstly I created the Contact class and implemented attributes and behaviors for a contact. 
Then I created the MobilePhone class which represents a simple mobile phone's attributes and behaviors like adding a new contact, deleting an existing contact etc.
I used encapsulation to limit interventions from outside.
I used composition between the Contact class and the MobilePhoneClass. 
This can be described as a MobilePhone has Contact/Contacts.
